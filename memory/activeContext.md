# Active Context — stellar-shell

**Current focus:** Create and populate the Memory Bank directory with core project context files and a starter task so future agents and contributors can find project-level guidance and pending work.

**Recent changes:**

- Added initial memory files (project brief, product context).
- Repository core: React + TypeScript, Vite, Three.js, React Three Fiber, BvxEngine for voxel data, ECS for game entities.

**Next steps:**

- Create `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md` and the `tasks/` folder with a `_index.md` and initial task files.
- Keep the `memory/` files up-to-date whenever project-level decisions or active tasks change.
- Add `memory/requirements.md` with EARS-style requirements to clarify acceptance criteria for core behaviors.

**Notes:**

- Follow the Memory Bank conventions: store requirements in `memory/requirements.md`, designs in `memory/designs/`, and tasks in `memory/tasks/`.
