# Project Brief — stellar-shell

**Purpose:** A small React + TypeScript demo that renders a voxel-based space scene using React Three Fiber and Three.js. It showcases voxel world mechanics, a lightweight engine for chunk management, and simple gameplay elements (drones, player, HUD).

**Goals:**

- Provide a compact, performant voxel renderer and game loop suitable for experimentation and demos.
- Maintain a clear separation between data (BvxEngine, voxel store) and rendering (React / R3F components).
- Keep the codebase easy to extend with new block types, gameplay systems, and rendering features.
